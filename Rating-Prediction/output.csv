"We have stayed at several hotels on the strip but none compare with Wynn. The staff are the nicest people you would want to meet. I can't say enough about the food no wonder it is rated so high. Our room was very nice, although when we were there it was very windy and being in a corner room the winds buffeted the windows on our first night, no big deal as we were so happy to be there it didn't matter. I don't rave about places, but, in this case I couldn't help it. We are going again April 3 2011. Only 8 more sleeps LOL",stayed several hotels strip none compare wynn staff nicest people would want meet say enough food wonder rated high room nice although windy corner room winds buffeted windows first night big deal happy matter rave places case help going april sleeps lol,5
"We went to Vegas for a 10/10/10 wedding at the Wynn. I was expecting great things...and was not disappointed. The room was fantastic - with one entire wall looking out over Vegas and Nevada. The bathroom was amazing! The amenities were awesome - and I am still using the shower gel and shampoo from there whenever I need a mini-vacation at home!! The BEST things about the Wynn is the long pool. I loved it! I could swim/walk up and down there all day! We ate at some of the hotel restaurants are were neither blown away nor disappointed. The staff were nice and professional and the casino was lucky for us. I would recommend the Wynn for sure...and if I had to go back to Vegas, I would stay there again.",went vegas wedding wynn expecting great things disappointed room fantastic one entire wall looking vegas nevada bathroom amazing amenities awesome still using shower gel shampoo whenever need mini vacation home best things wynn long pool loved could swim walk day ate hotel restaurants neither blown away disappointed staff nice professional casino lucky us would recommend wynn sure go back vegas would stay ,5
"This hotel was just as fantastic as expected! The rooms are huge and luxurious! We paid $150 to upgrade and I think it was worth it… you get a better view and better room decoration. I’d definitely recommend the buffet at the Wynn, it’s the best one I have ever been to!",hotel fantastic expected rooms huge luxurious paid upgrade think worth get better view better room decoration definitely recommend buffet wynn best one ever ,5
"The staff was quite friendly and accomodating. The rooms were nice size, clean and comfortable. We stayed on the 14th floor and the music from the club downstairs was overly annoying until 4 am. So much so that it is almost impossible to sleep. You would expect allot better for what is expected to be the so called ""class of Las Vegas"". The restaurants are overly priced for just ok food. Small portions. You could buy a whole bottle of alcohol for the price they charge for one drink in their bars. The only way I would go back again is for a business function and I would have to think about that.",staff quite friendly accomodating rooms nice size clean comfortable stayed floor music club downstairs overly annoying much almost impossible sleep would expect allot better expected called class las vegas restaurants overly priced ok food small portions could buy whole bottle alcohol price charge one drink bars way would go back business function would think ,3
"Stayed at the Wynn for 3 nights for a conference in March - received a corporate rate, so I can""t really speak to ""VALUE"" since I understand our rate was quite good. Check in was fine, although I found it a little slow, however the service was very courteous and helpful. I did end up with keys that did not have my name on them, but someone elses, but more on that later...... Hotel rooms are large and well appointed with almost everything you might need. The Good - the rooms were beautiful, staff very courteous and location was fantastic, right across from the Fashion Show Mall. The Bad - The pool doesn't open until 9 am, so early birds with a slight hangover have nowhere to go to nurse their aching heads. Like ever hotel in Vegas, the size is overwhelming and it is easy to get lost - the pool is very beautiful, however very hard to find a seat because they are all ""saved"". The Ugly - as I said I was there on a conference so I had some work to do. The business centre shuts down at 6pm and if you need something printed after that time.......well, I wish you a lot of luck. Although everyone tried to help and was very courteous, I was sent on a wild goose chase around the hotel and the Encore (did I mention it is huge) to find an ""internet station"", then told to email my file to the bell desk - who never got it and didn't know how to print something anyways and I ended up just giving up and getting up very early to find a KINKOS. Also when I tried to call other parties in the hotel, I was repeatedly told that the room was empty and that no-one was there, although if I went and knocked on the door the party was there and very confused. We also had a couple of issues with our door being opened by unknown people-not hotel staff (we asked housekeeping about it, they thought it was someone who was going to change all the clocks for daylight savings time - at 6 am without knocking and not in uniform 2 days before the time is changing?) I think this goes back to my check-in where I received keys that did not have my name on them........but I am just guessing here. I did make sure I put everything in the safe after that little incident. I think my experience at the Wynn was positive and outside my little weird incidents, I would recommend the Wynn, since I think my situation was the oddity, not the rule.",stayed wynn nights conference march received corporate rate really speak value since understand rate quite good check fine although found little slow however service courteous helpful end keys name someone elses later hotel rooms large well appointed almost everything might need good rooms beautiful staff courteous location fantastic right across fashion show mall bad pool open early birds slight hangover nowhere go nurse aching heads like ever hotel vegas size overwhelming easy get lost pool beautiful however hard find seat saved ugly said conference work business centre shuts need something printed time well wish lot luck although everyone tried help courteous sent wild goose chase around hotel encore mention huge find internet station told email file bell desk never got know print something anyways ended giving getting early find kinkos also tried call parties hotel repeatedly told room empty one although went knocked door party confused also couple issues door opened unknown people hotel staff asked housekeeping thought someone going change clocks daylight savings time without knocking uniform days time changing think goes back check received keys name guessing make sure put everything safe little incident think experience wynn positive outside little weird incidents would recommend wynn since think situation oddity rule ,4

"We started our stay midweek and left early Saturday morning. Last year we stayed at the Venetian and were very pleased. This year we tried the Wynn. We enjoyed the gambling experience and the room was contemporary and very nice. They failed to take out the prior guests garbage which my wife didn't like, but I forget to take out the garbage all the time. I saw it as an oversight I could deal with. She didn't share that opinion. The way the Encore theatre was set up for gambling and watching the tournament was very well done. The sportsbook on the other hand always had a long line and was understaffed. Games start at 9:30a people. Let's get more than 1 guy opening the place at 8:30a. I had to run over to the Encore to bet the early game with 1 minute to spare. At least they had 2 working. Our friends had a Tower Suite and that room was extraordinary. Our primary complaint was one shared by many folks going down for breakfast in the morning. The constant bass thumping from the club down below until 4 am was unacceptable. Mind you we gambled until 2 or 3 am and had our share of libations. Even from the 20th floor the club was insanely loud. The only way to get any sleep is to take a midday nap. Probably a good strategy for next time. Most likely I will book elsewhere.",started stay midweek left early saturday morning last year stayed venetian pleased year tried wynn enjoyed gambling experience room contemporary nice failed take prior guests garbage wife like forget take garbage time saw oversight could deal share opinion way encore theatre set gambling watching tournament well done sportsbook hand always long line understaffed games start people let get guy opening place run encore bet early game minute spare least working friends tower suite room extraordinary primary complaint one shared many folks going breakfast morning constant bass thumping club unacceptable mind gambled share libations even floor club insanely loud way get sleep take midday nap probably good strategy next time likely book elsewhere ,2
"We were a group of 14 friends travelling from India, and were really looking for a fun holiday of gambling, nice restaurants, fab clubs et al...the Wynn turned out to be the best place to stay because there was a restful lack of shrieking children and noisy families. The rooms at the Wynn are fab (and most of the stuff gets comped by the hotel at the end of a week's stay in any case). The restaurants are excellent, but the Kung Pao chicken from RED 8 has stayd with us, its magnificent. While at the Wynn, check out the night club...the Tryst...no point going there before midnight though, that's when it begins to rock. I loved the swimming pool (the main one, since the Wynn has multiple pools), and rate the breakfast buffet as amongst the best i've witnessed.",group friends travelling india really looking fun holiday gambling nice restaurants fab clubs et al wynn turned best place stay restful lack shrieking children noisy families rooms wynn fab stuff gets comped hotel end week stay case restaurants excellent kung pao chicken red stayd us magnificent wynn check night club tryst point going midnight though begins rock loved swimming pool main one since wynn multiple pools rate breakfast buffet amongst best witnessed ,4
"Firstly, we have stayed at the Wynn numerous times. For my wifes birthday we decided to book a ""Deluxe Panoramic View"". We were told how nice it was and the staff member had told us they had just been ""released for occupancy"". Upon early arrival we were told the room was not ready...no problem...we played in the casino for an hour before they called us to tell us it was ready. We got our room key and headed to the room. The ""Deluxe Panoramic View"" consisted of one window looking at the strip, mostly T.I and ...here's the kicker....the other window looking at a deserted waste area that looked like a construction zone. Not exactly the wonderful view we expected. We were in the room less than a minute before we decided that this was not acceptable for the description and price we were paying. I called the front desk and they offered to move us to a room on another floor with no Panoramic view and and discount the rate $25.00 per night. After checking out the second room and checking the rate online it was more than $100.00 a night less. When I informed the front desk of this we were told that "" That was not the rate today"". I argued that if we had been told that the Deluxe Panoramic View was not as ""deluxe"" as described then we would have had no problem just staying in a regular room and would have booked it at that time. Again we were told ""No"". Just so anyone understands, we were not trying to be cheap.We even inquired about upgrading to a suite and paying the difference but were told there were none available. After a few minutes we were put in contact with a supervisor who told us the same thing, But she did explain that in the future she will inform the staff to advise customers of the view...wonder if that will happen. At this point it was obvious we were not that important and they would rather not work with us on this problem so we decided to check out. My wife had been infomed by a work colleage that the Vdara in the new City Center was wonderful. We called the Vdara and they were able to give us a fantastic ""condo"" with all the amenities, comfortable bed, living room, kitchen, washer and dryer etc. that really was awesome. After a quick check in and looking out at a great view ( at last), we decided that the Wynn no longer deserves our loyalty. A problem that could has very easily been resolved tuned into a frustrating fiasco. In reality, the Wynn is a beautiful hotel which we have enjoyed many times before. Unfortunatly this experience has left us not wanting to spend our money in the Casino, Spa restaurants or shops at Wynn ever again. On the bright side, the Vdara was awesome!! Wonder if anyone else has been conned into booking the Deluxe Panoramic View room?",firstly stayed wynn numerous times wifes birthday decided book deluxe panoramic view told nice staff member told us released occupancy upon early arrival told room ready problem played casino hour called us tell us ready got room key headed room deluxe panoramic view consisted one window looking strip mostly kicker window looking deserted waste area looked like construction zone exactly wonderful view expected room less minute decided acceptable description price paying called front desk offered move us room another floor panoramic view discount rate per night checking second room checking rate online night less informed front desk told rate today argued told deluxe panoramic view deluxe described would problem staying regular room would booked time told anyone understands trying cheap even inquired upgrading suite paying difference told none available minutes put contact supervisor told us thing explain future inform staff advise customers view wonder happen point obvious important would rather work us problem decided check wife infomed work colleage vdara new city center wonderful called vdara able give us fantastic condo amenities comfortable bed living room kitchen washer dryer etc really awesome quick check looking great view last decided wynn longer deserves loyalty problem could easily resolved tuned frustrating fiasco reality wynn beautiful hotel enjoyed many times unfortunatly experience left us wanting spend money casino spa restaurants shops wynn ever bright side vdara awesome wonder anyone else conned booking deluxe panoramic view room ,1

"Spent 3 nights at the Wynn Las Vegas with my girlfriend and brother and his wife March 9-12 2011. If you are looking for exceptional luxury, excellence service and place that you will not want to leave, then spend your money here. The staff was friendly and genuinely cared about your every need. Make sure and sign up for the Red Card before you gamble, because Wynn is generous to regular players, lots of comps. This hotel is beautiful everywhere you turn, everything is top quality, from the pool, restaurants, casino to every amenity in the huge bath and guest room. Can't wait for my return trip.",spent nights wynn las vegas girlfriend brother wife march looking exceptional luxury excellence service place want leave spend money staff friendly genuinely cared every need make sure sign red card gamble wynn generous regular players lots comps hotel beautiful everywhere turn everything top quality pool restaurants casino every amenity huge bath guest room wait return trip ,5
"My wife and I stayed three nights at the Wynn during the Presidents Day holiday weekend. Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff was very nice and professional. There is a $20. per day resort fee which I didn't mind paying, but it does not include in-room wi-fi. You can use a wi-fi hot spot free in the hotel registration area and at a pizza restaurant in the hotel. Our hotel room was great with a very comfortable bed and a magnificent view of the strip. The room had excellent bathroom amenities i.e. shaving cream, shavers, toothbrushes, and even a t.v. mounted next to the vanity. The housekeeping staff did a great job and were very courteous. Our package came with nightly dinner at the Wynn Buffet which we really enjoyed. The regular price of the buffet is a little steep at $40. plus per person. Overall the buffet was very good with plenty to choose from. We also saw Le Reve, which is the Wynn's featured show. The theater where Le Reve is held is amazing, but we thought the show was just average. I used the resort gym which was also first class. The gym had state of the art equipment and provided towels, fresh fruit, and bottled water. Overall we had an excellent stay at the Wynn and hope to return soon.",wife stayed three nights wynn presidents day holiday weekend check quick easy staff nice professional per day resort fee mind paying include room wi fi use wi fi hot spot free hotel registration area pizza restaurant hotel hotel room great comfortable bed magnificent view strip room excellent bathroom amenities e shaving cream shavers toothbrushes even v mounted next vanity housekeeping staff great job courteous package came nightly dinner wynn buffet really enjoyed regular price buffet little steep plus per person overall buffet good plenty choose also saw le reve wynn featured show theater le reve held amazing thought show average used resort gym also first class gym state art equipment provided towels fresh fruit bottled water overall excellent stay wynn hope return soon ,5
"We have been to Las Vegas 24 times previous, and for our 25 We took a room at Wynn Tower Suites. In the past I have often bemoaned the passing of the Dessert Inn. It was such a classy place with a lot of history, I had always been reluctant to stay at Wynn since it was torn down to build it. Folks, I am here to tell you that the Wynn does outclass ANY hotel that I have ever experienced in all my travels anywhere. Room quality could not be better, but the level of service is something that any business should aspire to achieve. The entire staff makes you feel that the entire place is yours, and do this without being obtrusive. This level of service is prevailant at all levels from the restaurant , to the Parking Valet, casino hosts, and front desk staff. Rooms are serviced twice daily, with an amazing attention to detail, Room service is prompt and well served. Food quality is superior. The buffet has been always considered the best in Las Vegas, but even the casual dining, in the coffee shop, or the Red 8 Chinese restaurant, is excellent, with the same level of that Wynn service. Pool areas were open, but not in use due to February weather, Tower Suites have an exclusive pool as well. Our room had a beautiful view of the golf course, which was also not in much use due to weather. I will always make Wynn / Encore my first consideration on subsequent stays, and would recommend this property to anyone.",las vegas times previous took room wynn tower suites past often bemoaned passing dessert inn classy place lot history always reluctant stay wynn since torn build folks tell wynn outclass hotel ever experienced travels anywhere room quality could better level service something business aspire achieve entire staff makes feel entire place without obtrusive level service prevailant levels restaurant parking valet casino hosts front desk staff rooms serviced twice daily amazing attention detail room service prompt well served food quality superior buffet always considered best las vegas even casual dining coffee shop red chinese restaurant excellent level wynn service pool areas open use due february weather tower suites exclusive pool well room beautiful view golf course also much use due weather always make wynn encore first consideration subsequent stays would recommend property anyone ,5
"Let me start out by saying I stayed here mid-week and paid about $200 a night, which isn't bad overall but for mid-week in Vegas you have a lot of options at that price... Likes--great service, clean rooms, beautiful facility, lots of amenities. Dislikes--I felt like I was nickel and dimed to death. Most Vegas hotels you pay a ""resort fee"" and most items are covered. Here, everything is a la carte and expensive; $14 a day for Internet for each laptop or phone you connect, the minibar is expensive ($8 for jelly beans); heck, they even charge you $25 if you put anything in the fridge in your room. These items should be included. My TV stopped working (didn't care, its Vegas, but for the price), I was in room 6030 so I heard the elevators going up and down all day and night and just overall it's a very nice place but the value wasn't there for me. There are places almost as nice in Vegas on the strip at half the price that include more (I have been to Vegas 10+ times).",let start saying stayed mid week paid night bad overall mid week vegas lot options price likes great service clean rooms beautiful facility lots amenities dislikes felt like nickel dimed death vegas hotels pay resort fee items covered everything la carte expensive day internet laptop phone connect minibar expensive jelly beans heck even charge put anything fridge room items included tv stopped working care vegas price room heard elevators going day night overall nice place value places almost nice vegas strip half price include vegas times ,3
"My husband and I spent two nights at the Wynn hotel 02/28-03/01, and it was a truly wonderful stay. We were in Las Vegas for nine night and spent the bulk of it at New York, New York (obviously no comparison between the two hotels!), but wanted to end our USA holiday somewhere a bit more fancy!! I spent many an hour on trip advisor and debated for quite awhile whether we wanted to spend our last couple of nights at the Bellagio or Wynn. So, so glad we went with Wynn!! My husband and I are certainly not VIP’s or High Rollers, and probably only gambled about $200 the entire time in Las Vegas, but from the moment our taxi pulled up to the Wynn the service was amazing. ( I was a bit worried as I had read many reviews about people being unhappy with the customer service) Every staff member we encountered was so lovely and helpful, the Bell Man who took our bags from the taxi (more than what we arrived with in the USA after some serious shopping!!) was amazing, welcomed us to the Wynn, enquired if it was our first time and directed us to check – in. Once we got to check in I was prepared to have to wait for a room, as it was just before 1pm and check in was not until 3, but the room was available immediately and we were able to go up straight away. The woman at check in was also lovely and helpful, provided us with a map and made sure we had no further enquires. I had made our booking online, directly through the Wynn website, and in my booking had requested a high floor with a strip view if possible, I was aware that they cannot guarantee rooms, so did not get my hopes up , but I got exactly what I had requested, 58th floor, Strip view!!! Amazing - the room was pretty much right in the center of the building and close to the lifts!! Also of note was that throughout the entire booking process, calling to confirm reservation and check in process, they were totally upfront about the Resort Fee, so I was prepare to pay for this, and more than happy to as my husband used the Fitness centre a couple of times and I wanted to use the internet. The room was immaculate, I believe it was one of the recently refurbished rooms, amazing, comfortable bed, lovely couch and ottoman. Pretty much every amenity you could need, decent minibar/snack bar, pricey, but that is to be expected (peanut brittle is pretty tasty!). We then called the bell desk to have our bags brought up to the room, the person who brought our bags up was also fabulous, enquired if it was our first stay at the Wynn, welcomed us to the hotel, showed us how all the gadgets worked, told my husband how to get the fitness centre, gave us a bit of local knowledge (he got a big tip!) and made sure we had no further questions. The bath and shower are huge, great pressure in the shower, towels were also lovely and separate toilet. View during the day was lovely of the strip and mountains in the distance, then once it got dark the strip lights were spectacular, it is a shame the Palazzo blocks some of the view down the strip though. We ordered some late night room service during our stay, which was delivered pretty quickly and the table was also taken away promptly, we ordered the Deli meats platter for two, which we were both pretty happy with. We ate twice at the Terrace Point Café for breakfast, my husband had tea and cereal both times that he was happy with, I had an omelete one day and fruit platter the next, both were lovely (fruit lovely and fresh), and I could not finish either of them. We also had dinner at the buffet, it was very good and we were both full, afterwards, but to be honest I was a little bit disappointed in the selection of savoury food, I don’t eat seafood, so was not interested in the crab legs (we were seated near the seafood section and it was quite hilarious watching the people go nuts over the crab legs, I think some people thought that the ocean was about to dry up of crab and they would never get to eat them again!) However I was impressed with the dessert selection, unfortunately I could only manage one trip up to that section! On our last day, we checked out a 12pm, I chose to check out at the front desk, as I had forgotten to take notice of the paintings in reception when we checked in and wanted to look (unsure who the artist was but they were lovely!), there was not queue and this was also quick and easy, great service again, here and we were given the charges to go over, and everything was fine. We left our bags in storage with the hotel, as our flight was not until about 7pm that night and then went for a cocktail at Parasol Down, this is my new favourite bar, and wish we had gone their earlier. Great cocktails, welcoming hostess and fab waitresses. We sat out on the terrace looking over the lake and waterfall, like I said wish I had gone down there before then and at night to watch the lake show. We then left for a couple of hours and had lunch at another hotel, and a bit of last minute shopping. We then returned to Parasol Down to have our final Las Vegas drink before heading to the airport. The staff were again welcoming and both the hostess and waitress welcomed us back. Then when we left the bell staff who grabbed our bags and taxi for us, were also great. I was worried about feeling out of place in a hotel such as the Wynn, where people bet more in one hand than I make in a year, but this was not the case at all. I also loved all the little features, like my name on the phone, tv and key card! .

"Stayed here 2 weeks ago, was recommend by Trailfinders, stayed for 3 nights. This is opulence personified, The Wynn experience begins at check in which was speedy and efficient, even the room cards are printed with your names and are yours to keep, it also affords privileges like going to the quick queuefor The Buffet. Was asked whether I wanted to upgrade to a room with a Strip view for $30 a night, declined that and got a room on the 20th floor(non smoking) with a golf course view, what a view, to die for, the sunrise was on cue at 6:15 every morning. The room was massive and clean, the bathroom was also massive with seperate shower. The staff throughout the hotel, they were cheerful and polite, had smiles, made you feel welcomed and important. The ladies at the conceirge were very helpful in sending postcards for you, as they do not sell stamps, it goes through the Wynn mail centre and charged to your account. The facilities were on the whole very good, The Buffet had excellent choices of food, unfortunately only one of the pools were open, that was at the sister Encore, the gym where there was charge of $15 a day was basic and got very busy by 8am, so room for improvement there. Word of caution, they charge a resort fee of $150 a day , cash or credit card to cover for loses or damges. Some reviews have mentioned the noise, never had a problem, maybe it was the start of the week. Checkout was early, and extra were correctly charged. Would defintely stay here again.",stayed weeks ago recommend trailfinders stayed nights opulence personified wynn experience begins check speedy efficient even room cards printed names keep also affords privileges like going quick queuefor buffet asked whether wanted upgrade room strip view night declined got room floor non smoking golf course view view die sunrise cue every morning room massive clean bathroom also massive seperate shower staff throughout hotel cheerful polite smiles made feel welcomed important ladies conceirge helpful sending postcards sell stamps goes wynn mail centre charged account facilities whole good buffet excellent choices food unfortunately one pools open sister encore gym charge day basic got busy room improvement word caution charge resort fee day cash credit card cover loses damges reviews mentioned noise never problem maybe start week checkout early extra correctly charged would defintely stay ,5
"I came here for a business conference in December. The rooms were large, modern, comfortable, and very clean. I stayed in Mandalay Bay in November for a business conference as well and compared to Mandalay Bay, the Wynn is much nicer and updated. The conference center was also very impressive. The breakfast, coffee, drinks were delicious and the staff was very helpful and professional. I was disappointed in the food at the Wynn (which is why I am giving it 4 stars and not 5). I ordered room service, and ate at 4 different restaurants and all was fine, but not impressive. As can be expected, the prices for meals is outrageous, so I would recommend grabbing a sandwich or salad at one of the little cafes, rather than spend a load of money on a middle of the road meal. I also used the spa while I was there. I got a manicure and a pedicure (both some of the best I've ever received) and then spent a few hours in the very relaxing and beautiful spa area. I look forward to going back to the Wynn in March for yet another conference when I can use the pool!",came business conference december rooms large modern comfortable clean stayed mandalay bay november business conference well compared mandalay bay wynn much nicer updated conference center also impressive breakfast coffee drinks delicious staff helpful professional disappointed food wynn giving stars ordered room service ate different restaurants fine impressive expected prices meals outrageous would recommend grabbing sandwich salad one little cafes rather spend load money middle road meal also used spa got manicure pedicure best ever received spent hours relaxing beautiful spa area look forward going back wynn march yet another conference use pool ,4
"This hotel met or exceeded every expectation. Check-in was quick and seamless from front desk to bellstaff. The room was ready exactly on time, and it was adjacent to our friends’ room, as requested. Every amenity was anticipated, from a basket containing all manner of personal care products, plenty of towels, bathrobes, slippers, ironing board, hair dryer, in-room safe, televisions in both the bedroom and the bath; soaking tub and separate stall shower. Touch controls at the door and bedside for all lights, temperature, privacy, housekeeping call and window shades. Any small problems were attended to in literally minutes. We are not huge gamblers, but enjoy Las Vegas for the shows, shopping and restaurants. The Wynn is a comfortable walk to the Fashion Show mall, the Venetian shops and restaurants, and not terribly far from the Caesar’s Palace Forum shops. We did not have a car and cannot comment on the parking. We ate at a number of the restaurants on premises: Red 8, a casual pan-Asian restaurant which served the best pad Thai I have ever had (really! Fresh, not oily, not salty or cloying - just right!); Botero, fine dining featuring artworks by the famous sculptor/painter - every single dish a hit; the Buffet for Sunday brunch with a huge variety and the most spectacular “Garden room” which provides a feast for the eyes as well; Parasol Up/Parasol Down, a bar opposite a multi-story man-made waterfall with a regular nightly light show. Our friends had an even numbered room that looked over the (empty) golf course, our odd numbered room overlooked the Strip. Rooms were pretty sound-proof. The facility was quite empty during the week, but Friday and Saturday it was packed - lines all over for the nightclubs which seemed to attract a broad spectrum of younger people. We preferred the casino floor of the Venetian which has a no-smoking in the aisles policy. The only quibble I had with the room is that the toilet was perched rather high and featured a contoured seat that resulted in one’s feet not touching the floor when one was seated. I am 5’1”, but my 5’7” husband had the same problem. The public spaces were lush and well-maintained. If you hate add-on fees, be aware that there is a $20/day “resort fee” which includes access to the gym (which my husband enjoyed) and room wi-fi (not the sharpest). We were very happy with the amenities and the service provided at the Wynn and would definitely return here on our next trip.",hotel met exceeded every expectation check quick seamless front desk bellstaff room ready exactly time adjacent friends room requested every amenity anticipated basket containing manner personal care products plenty towels bathrobes slippers ironing board hair dryer room safe televisions bedroom bath soaking tub separate stall shower touch controls door bedside lights temperature privacy housekeeping call window shades small problems attended literally minutes huge gamblers enjoy las vegas shows shopping restaurants wynn comfortable walk fashion show mall venetian shops restaurants terribly far caesar palace forum shops car cannot comment parking ate number restaurants premises red casual pan asian restaurant served best pad thai ever really fresh oily salty cloying right botero fine dining featuring artworks famous sculptor painter every single dish hit buffet sunday brunch huge variety spectacular garden room provides feast eyes well parasol parasol bar opposite multi story man made waterfall regular nightly light show friends even numbered room looked empty golf course odd numbered room overlooked strip rooms pretty sound proof facility quite empty week friday saturday packed lines nightclubs seemed attract broad spectrum younger people preferred casino floor venetian smoking aisles policy quibble room toilet perched rather high featured contoured seat resulted one feet touching floor one seated husband problem public spaces lush well maintained hate add fees aware day resort fee includes access gym husband enjoyed room wi fi sharpest happy amenities service provided wynn would definitely return next trip ,4
"We recently were guests for a business convention. This hotel is definitely a 5 star in all ways! The accommodations are superb...the food....excellent...meeting rooms and convention staff are all top-notch. Sometimes you can attend a large convention and the meals you're served are mediocre at best. Not at the Wynn. Though most meals served to our large group were buffet style, they were way above par. The hotel location on the strip is great...very close to Fashion Show Mall with many wonderful shops. We tried the buffet in the hotel based on other TripAdvisor reviews and were not dissappointed. Terrific selection of outstanding seafood-Crab Legs cut lengthwise for easy eating...Lamb Shank tasty and tender....Veal, Sushi, Pasta made to order, Asian, salads, you name it! Make sure you save room for dessert...the variety and quality are second to none! Warm, fresh crepes with your choice of filling were a pleasant and unexpected surprise. Lots of other restaurant options in this hotel as well.",recently guests business convention hotel definitely star ways accommodations superb food excellent meeting rooms convention staff top notch sometimes attend large convention meals served mediocre best wynn though meals served large group buffet style way par hotel location strip great close fashion show mall many wonderful shops tried buffet hotel based tripadvisor reviews dissappointed terrific selection outstanding seafood crab legs cut lengthwise easy eating lamb shank tasty tender veal sushi pasta made order asian salads name make sure save room dessert variety quality second none warm fresh crepes choice filling pleasant unexpected surprise lots restaurant options hotel well ,5

"Service was terrible! Of all the staff members I encountered during my stay, only 2 were moderately polite. The staff often referred to 'their policies' that were never disclosed upon reservation or check-in. Don't bother complaining- they just treat you worse. We got food poisioning from room service and the staff adamently claimed the food was not bad- even though it looked like it had rotted for a week. While trying to get some rest and recover, there was constant banging and noise from outside and above the room. The room itself was beautiful, but I prefer decent service. The food at the casual dining restaurants was average but incredibly over priced. Room service takes forever! We booked at the Wynn because of its great reputation and thought it would enhance our Vegas experience. In the end, it totally took away from the enjoyment of our trip. I would recommend 3 star Vegas casinos over the Wynn unless you enjoy being treated like crap.",service terrible staff members encountered stay moderately polite staff often referred policies never disclosed upon reservation check bother complaining treat worse got food poisioning room service staff adamently claimed food bad even though looked like rotted week trying get rest recover constant banging noise outside room room beautiful prefer decent service food casual dining restaurants average incredibly priced room service takes forever booked wynn great reputation thought would enhance vegas experience end totally took away enjoyment trip would recommend star vegas casinos wynn unless enjoy treated like crap ,2

"Went with my husband and our two teenage children. We all loved the Wynn. The room was tremendous. The room had huge glass windows and high ceilings and was extremely comfortable for a family of four. The bathrooms were beautiful and very clean. We loved the elegance of the hotel. They could use a couple of more casual restaurants for teenagers but my kids loved the Zoocracker restaurant where they could get wings nachos and burgers. Really no place cheap to go for breakfast. You could spend close to $100 on breakfast with a glass of orange juice was $7. Might as well get a mimosa for $9. If you want a great cheap breakfast go outside hotel to Ellis Island. Amazing cheap breakfast and delicious. We went to the SW Steakhouse which was amazing. The food was mouth watering. We went with a party of seven and loved the atmosphere. You are going to drop a lot of money in this restaurant, so be prepared but enjoy. We were prepared to spend a lot of money but it was worth every cent. The porterhouse steak was OMG melt in your mouth!!! All in all we loved the Wynn!!!!",went husband two teenage children loved wynn room tremendous room huge glass windows high ceilings extremely comfortable family four bathrooms beautiful clean loved elegance hotel could use couple casual restaurants teenagers kids loved zoocracker restaurant could get wings nachos burgers really place cheap go breakfast could spend close breakfast glass orange juice might well get mimosa want great cheap breakfast go outside hotel ellis island amazing cheap breakfast delicious went sw steakhouse amazing food mouth watering went party seven loved atmosphere going drop lot money restaurant prepared enjoy prepared spend lot money worth every cent porterhouse steak omg melt mouth loved wynn ,5
"Wynn has been our favorite Las Vegas hotel for several years but this year watch out!. You will be charged a “resort fee” of $20 a day so plan to add that amount to your daily rate. It covers internet, fitness center and a couple other things. Since the internet fee is only $13.95/day you will be forced to overpay by being charged the resort fee. Additionally, Wynn has the usual snacks in the room. A substantial number of small charges from the room snacks appeared on our bill when we were checking out (but not before). It was unpleasant to get them removed. First someone was sent to our room to verify if we had used anything. We had not. He was slow and since we were trying to leave for the airport we had to make several calls to get him there. Next, the front desk claimed the bill could not be corrected for 24 hours. After an unpleasant exchange they did credit our account for $75 but clearly did not want to. They also did not apologize but instead insisted that we must have handled the items which we did not. This all seems like a cheesy scam to me so watch your bill carefully! I will be looking for a different hotel next year!",wynn favorite las vegas hotel several years year watch charged resort fee day plan add amount daily rate covers internet fitness center couple things since internet fee day forced overpay charged resort fee additionally wynn usual snacks room substantial number small charges room snacks appeared bill checking unpleasant get removed first someone sent room verify used anything slow since trying leave airport make several calls get next front desk claimed bill could corrected hours unpleasant exchange credit account clearly want also apologize instead insisted must handled items seems like cheesy scam watch bill carefully looking different hotel next year ,4
