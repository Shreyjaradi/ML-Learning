# Rating Prediction Model

The input file contains the "Review" column, the **Prediction model** will predict the rating.
The dataset used in this python file is from **[link](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/)**
I train the model with  **[this](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/)** dataset.
I used fasttext algorithm to train the model.
